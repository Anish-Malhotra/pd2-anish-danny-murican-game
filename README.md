> Originally starting as the idea of Space Invaders, this game has taken on a wild twist of its own. Experience the life of an American Air Force pilot fighting the Kamikaze Japanese Air Force! Defeat the waves of Japanese aircraft and destroy them once and for all!

### Running the Game
Compile the source using `javac Game.java`  
Run the compiled files using `java Game`

### Controls
Like any standard game, you can use the `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right` arrows keys to move your aircraft.  
Use the `spacebar` to shoot.

### Gameplay
There are ten levels to this game: nine waves and a boss battle. As you destroy enemy planes, you will gain experience and rank up. Traverse through the various ranks of the airforce from Airman to the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force! Along the way, there will be a famous figure supporting and encouraging you. But be warned, as you rank up, the Japanese will start sending more and stronger aircraft at you!  
**Be ready to fight!**
